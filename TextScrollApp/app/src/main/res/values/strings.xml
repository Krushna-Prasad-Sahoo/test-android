This is KP. Unlike other IT enthusiasts, I am highly inclined and passionate towards IT operations which includes amazing stuffs like Automation, Optimization, Infrastructure, Networking, Configurations, Monitoring, High Availability & Disaster Recovery Setup etc. Though I have some experience in development like Web Development using HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap or WordPress or Python Flask, BPM solutions using Appian Platform however I just love to spend time on Linux terminals & servers, creating some personalized container images, experimenting in cloud platforms like AWS or AZ or GCP or automating stuffs using some tools like Ansible or Terraform or Python/Shell scripting etc. And finally I have joined my dream organisation, Red Hat.]]></string>
