#### Just wanted to give a try for android app development. 

I just accepted the 30 days challenge by **Miss Saumya Singh**. Her 30+ android dev videos are available on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTV_nsuD2lf4UCTV6xwvNPvFdmCNKyhc8&si=TeQeeUKgmylKG1Mx) for free. I will be updating here my day wise things learnings and practice materials. All my source codes will also be placed in this repo. I am super excited to start my android dev journey.

Day 01 (18th October 2023)

1. Downloaded and installed Android Studio from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio). I can see my installed app details as below :

~~~
Android Studio Giraffe | 2022.3.1 Patch 2
Build #AI-223.8836.35.2231.10811636, built on September 15, 2023

2. Created `First Demo App` from a template kind of thing with name `Empty Activity`. It took 6-7 minutes for me for completed gradle build/sync.

3. Configured `Google Pixel 7` as my emulator. I downloaded `API 34` as my system image for the emulator. It was around 1.4 GB. And I noticed `Pixel 3a` was already available for me to use as emulator.

Day 02 (19th October 2023)

1. In [this 2nd video](https://youtu.be/oUYgLzmUl0o?si=3twinfVD6-GQYVB_) I got a nice overview / structural and components understanding of the Android Studio. I checked them out myself in my system. Tried navigating all the buttons / getting ready to make hand dirty!!!
2. In [this 3rd video](https://youtu.be/ppPX65NU7ko?si=-O4M1lgS0P24AOhK) I understood / learnt some Kotlin or I can say Android Dev things, created my first Android App (tried myself in my phone + shared with my friends as well). From [here](https://github.com/Krushna-Prasad-Sahoo/test-android/blob/main/high-low-app_19thOct2023.apk) the same app can be downloaded & tried. The name I have given as `high-low-app_19thOct2023.apk`. And don't worry, it don't have any virus hahah xD

Day 03 (20th October 2023)

1. In this [4th video](https://youtu.be/qllC71SYHz4?si=5xp9e-AKqDdPHz6b) I learnt and tried to build a simple interactive app. Where there will be 2 buttons (black & tale). If you click black, the app backgroud / layout will be black and the same goes for other button. It was simple and niceeee :)

Day 04 (21st October 2023)

1. In this [5th video](https://youtu.be/QltvZXWsba4?si=TcRAy_XnMuNOnbtD) I understood the concept of multiple Layouts such as `Constraint Layout`, `Linear Layout` & `Relative Layout`. I saw some of their example use cases & I feel after implementing or playing around that will make me realise the concept thoroughly.
