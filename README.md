#### Just wanted to give a try for android app development. 

I just accepted the 30 days challenge by `Miss Saumya Singh`. Her 30+ android dev videos are available on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTV_nsuD2lf4UCTV6xwvNPvFdmCNKyhc8&si=TeQeeUKgmylKG1Mx) for free. I will be updating here my day wise things learnings and practice materials. All my source codes will also be placed in this repo. I am super excited to start my android dev journey.
